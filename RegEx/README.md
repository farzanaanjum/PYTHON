Regular Expression:

   A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.


RegEx Functions:
  1. findall:	  Returns a list containing all matches
  2. search:	  Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
  3. split:	    Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
  4. sub:	      Replaces one or many matches with a string
